# About Me

Hello! I'm Brian, a software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. My journey in technology has been driven by a passion for solving real-world problems. With a Master's degree in IT focused on Machine Learning and a foundation in Informatics, I bring a comprehensive and forward-thinking approach to software development.

For the past six years, I've been immersed in building cloud-native applications that serve users across eight African countries. I thrive on the challenge of designing distributed systems and microservices that are not only robust and scalable but also deliver a seamless user experience.

Beyond the code, I'm a firm believer in the power of mentorship. Guiding junior developers and creating clear technical documentation is something I find incredibly rewarding, as it strengthens the entire team and accelerates our collective success. I am always eager to connect with fellow developers and innovators, so please feel free to reach out!
